# MS Analytics Project Week 2024 with Best Buy

## Team 7: Analytical Midtowners

This is our project for Georgia Tech's MS Analytics Project Week 2024, organized with Best Buy's data science team. The goal of this project was to create a model to classify customer call transcripts by reason for call. From the Best Buy team's experiments, it was known that modern LLMs like GPT-3.5 can perform well on this task. Our objective was to train a model that was lightweight and could mimic GPT-3.5's performance - essentially a knowledge distillation problem. We solved this problem using a combination of TF-IDF, XGBoost, and cascading. Check out our presentation for a more detailed look at our solution!
